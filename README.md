# IIR_Filter
Simple implementation of a IIR Filter with a sinusoidal impulse response. This Filter can be used as a sine wave oscillator.

1)IIR_Filter_tb.v is a verilog testbench file.
2)IIR_Filter.v is the module that implements the filter in Verilog.
3)IIR.sce is a scilab file created as a sketch.
